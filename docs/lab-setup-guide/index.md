# Lab Infrastructure Setup Guide

Welcome to the lab infrastructure setup guide! 

Here, we provide detailed instructions for setting up the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the interactive lab exercises included in the curriculum. Each topic requiring specific infrastructure has its own dedicated setup guide tailored to the needs of that particular module.

These labs are designed to give students hands-on experience with real-world tools and technologies, enhancing their learning and understanding of key concepts. Professors, administrators, or self-learners can use these guides to prepare environments where students can practice and apply their knowledge.
