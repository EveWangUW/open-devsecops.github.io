ðŸ‘‹ For the Team:
ok i tried to research this topic, im pretty sure this is a term amy ko made up. she wrote a book about it but theres no other information online - im not sure if there was something else we wanted to replace this with cuz i linked the book above but it doesn't really cover anything i feel like is worth putting in here but idk. if u search it up only ischool stuff comes up.
