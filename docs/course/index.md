## What is DevSecOps and CI/CD? üîç
**DevSecOps** is an integration of **development** (Dev), **security** (Sec), and **operations** (Ops) practices. It's a cultural shift that emphasizes security as a fundamental part of the software development lifecycle. By introducing security early in the development process, DevSecOps ensures that it's a shared responsibility and not just an afterthought.<sup>1-3</sup>

**CI/CD**, which stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**, complements DevSecOps by automating the software delivery process. Continuous Integration refers to the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing. Continuous Delivery extends this by automatically releasing the validated changes to a repository, while Continuous Deployment goes a step further by automatically deploying the changes into production.<sup>4-6</sup>

Our [Literature Review](../others/research/literature-review) provides a comprehensive look at existing academic and industry knowledge on DevSecOps.

## Why are they Important?üåü
- **Rapid and Secure Deployment**: In a fast-paced tech environment, the ability to quickly develop and deploy software is crucial. DevSecOps and CI/CD enable this rapid deployment while maintaining high security standards.
- **Reduced Risk**: Early integration of security in the development process significantly reduces vulnerabilities and the risk of late-stage security issues.
- **Efficiency and Reliability**: Automation in CI/CD ensures that each integration is tested and validated, reducing human errors and increasing the reliability of the release process.
- **Cost-Effective**: Identifying and fixing issues early in the development cycle is less expensive than making changes after deployment. This approach saves resources and time.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Organizations that adopt these practices are more agile, can respond faster to market changes, and offer more secure and reliable products.

Incorporating DevSecOps and CI/CD practices into academic curricula prepares students to meet the demands of modern software engineering, making them valuable assets to the industry from the outset.
